## DH 150 Assignment05: Personas and Scenarios
##### By Austin Sanchez


## Purpose of UX Storytelling
>UX storytelling allows designers to put themselves in the shoes of their users. By understanding their needs, capabilities, and behaviors, designers can create products that improve lives. The process of UX storytelling--from persona creation to journey mapping--allows designers to shift their persepctive. This perspective switch is essential to getting to the core of users' pain points and issues. The development of a persona allows a team to be on the same page when making design decisions. 

## Three Features for the Wall Street Journal Mobile App
>After conducting usability tests and interviews, I've noticed a recurring theme regarding the WSJ App's usability. In short, its organization can be improved.

#### 1. Navigation Bar on Home Page
>Users have voiced the need for a feature to easily navigate from section to section. My interviewee said he loves the way The Washington Post allows users to tailor their reading to certain sections. I plan to redesign the WSJ Mobile App in a similar way to give users a sense of organization.

#### 2. Featured News for Stocks on Watchlist
>Many WSJ readers are young investors who take advantage of the app's "market data" section. This section allows people to keep up-to-date with the market, specifically adding stocks to a "watchlist." Information--from earnings to changes in management--about these companies is crucial for users who utilize the WSJ app for their financial information. Therefore, I believe a section with articled pertaining to companies on one's "watchlist" will enhance the user experience.


#### 3. Customizable News Feed
>While my interviewee said he doesn't want a customized news feed, he acknowledged that the vast majority of people do. An app that I've used for a while (Medium) has an incredibly intuitive process to create a page with custimized content. I've attached an image of this process below.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Scenario #1: Josh Ferguson
>Josh Ferguson is a financial analyst living in New York City. Every day, he gets to the office by 8 AM and stays well after 8 PM. Back in college, Josh majored in finance and has a strong understanding of the stock market. His job takes up the bulk of his life: Josh eats, sleeps, and dreams finance. He yearns to be the best analyst for his firm and always keeps up with the daily trends of the stock market. However, Josh has limited time to do so due to the demanding nature of his job. He typically reads the Wall Street Journal on his commute to and from work. Josh gets frustrated when he can't find information efficiently because it infereres with his busy schedule.
> Josh utilizes the WSJ app to keep track of the stock market. He particularly enjoys the "watchlist" feature that allows him to add companies to a personalized page. Currently, the watchlist page only provided information about stock price changes. Josh views this as important information, but he also wants more comprehensive coverage of the companies he's added to his watchlist. Specifically, he would want recent articles pertaining to the companies to make an informed decision whether to buy or sell.
