>After conducting usability tests and interviews, I've noticed a recurring theme regarding the WSJ App's usability. In short, its organization can be improved.

#### 1. Navigation Bar on Home Page
>Users have voiced the need for a feature to easily navigate from section to section. My interviewee said he loves the way The Washington Post allows users to tailor their reading to certain sections. I plan to redesign the WSJ Mobile App in a similar way to give users a sense of organization.

#### 2. Featured News for Stocks on Watchlist
>Many WSJ readers are young investors who take advantage of the app's "market data" section. This section allows people to keep up-to-date with the market, specifically adding stocks to a "watchlist." Information--from earnings to changes in management--about these companies is crucial for users who utilize the WSJ app for their financial information. Therefore, I believe a section with articled pertaining to companies on one's "watchlist" will enhance the user experience.


#### 3. Customizable News Feed
>While my interviewee said he doesn't want a customized news feed, he acknowledged that the vast majority of people do. An app that I've used for a while (Medium) has an incredibly intuitive process to create a page with custimized content. I've attached an image of this process below.
