## DH 150 Assignment05: Personas and Scenarios
##### By Austin Sanchez


## Purpose of UX Storytelling
>UX storytelling allows designers to put themselves in the shoes of their users. By understanding their needs, capabilities, and behaviors, designers can create products that improve lives. The process of UX storytelling--from persona creation to journey mapping--allows designers to shift their persepctive. This perspective switch is essential to getting to the core of users' pain points and issues. The development of a persona allows a team to be on the same page when making design decisions. 

## Three Features for the Wall Street Journal Mobile App
>After conducting usability tests and interviews, I've noticed a recurring theme regarding the WSJ App's usability. In short, its organization can be improved. I've listed three ways in which I hope to enhance tha app's organizational structure.

#### 1. Navigation Bar on Home Page
>Users have voiced the need for a feature to easily navigate from section to section. My interviewee said he loves the way The Washington Post allows users to tailor their reading to certain sections. I plan to redesign the WSJ Mobile App in a similar way to give users a sense of organization.

#### 2. Featured News for Stocks on Watchlist
>Many WSJ readers are young investors who take advantage of the app's "market data" section. This section allows people to keep up-to-date with the market, specifically adding stocks to a "watchlist." Information--from earnings to changes in management--about these companies is crucial for users who utilize the WSJ app for their financial information. Therefore, I believe a section with articles pertaining to companies on one's "watchlist" will enhance the user experience.


#### 3. Customizable News Feed
>While my interviewee said he doesn't want a customized news feed, he acknowledged that the vast majority of people do. An app that I've used for a while (Medium) has an incredibly intuitive process to create a page with customized content. I've attached an image of this process below.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Scenario #1: Josh Ferguson
>Josh Ferguson is a financial analyst living in New York City. Every day, he gets to the office by 8 AM and stays well after 8 PM. Back in college, Josh majored in finance and has a strong understanding of the stock market. His job takes up the bulk of his life: Josh eats, sleeps, and dreams finance. He yearns to be the best analyst for his firm and always keeps up with the daily trends of the stock market. However, Josh has limited time to do so due to the demanding nature of his job. He typically reads the Wall Street Journal on his commutes to and from work. Josh gets frustrated when he can't find information efficiently because it infereres with his busy schedule.


> Josh utilizes the WSJ app to keep track of the stock market. He particularly enjoys the "watchlist" feature that allows him to add companies to a personalized page. On his ride home, Josh is considering buying stock in Google. Before doing so, he wants to add the company to his watchlist and observe the company over the next few weeks. Josh searches "Google." He adds the stock to his watchlist and sees today's closing price. Currently, the watchlist page only provides information about stock price changes. Josh views this as important information, but he also wants more comprehensive coverage of the companies he's added to his watchlist. Specifically, he would want recent articles pertaining to the companies' operations to make an informed decision whether to buy or sell. Instead of seeing this information in his watchlist, Josh goes to the search feature and types "Google" again. Josh thinks there can be a more efficient way to achieve his goal.

### Scenario #2: Alexis Jones
>Alexis is a first-generation college student at UCLA. She majors in political science with aspirations to one day serve in public office. Alexis loves learning and takes the initiative to read as much as she can. Her professors have suggested subscribing to the Wall Street Journal, so she recently downloaded the mobile app.


>Alexis enjoys learning about all things--from art to sports--but she specifically downloaded the WSJ app for its trusted news on U.S. and World affairs. These are the two topics she wants to read about most, but frequently faces trouble sorting the content of the app. Each headline insinuates the topic of the article, but Alexis wants a home page where she doesn't have to decipher the content of the article before reading. She wants to be able to select "politics" and have an abundance of options to choose from. 


>Alexis is an advanced user in terms of her technical abilities. In other apps, she's had the option to create a news feed with her favorite topics or customize her notifications. Currently, Alexis goes to the Wall Street Journal home page and scrolls through the content. She sees an article about an emerging tech company, then one about the coronavirus pandemic. After additional scrolling, she sees an article about Amazon and Macy's releasing their quarterly earnings. Finally, she stumbles upon an article about world politics: the protests in Hong Kong. Alexis believes there could have been an easier way to get to her desired content. 

### Scenario #3: Todd Fraser
>Todd is a 35 year-old man married with two kids. He works as a health care professional. Todd consults the Wall Street Journal every morning for the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic. Typically, he visits the website on his laptop but recently he's been getting called in for shifts earlier in the day. Todd usually likes to read about a variety of subjects, but for the last few months coronavirus has been the only thing on his mind. Not only is he personally interested in the news developments, but it's an important supplement for his job as a health care professional. Todd downloaded the WSJ Mobile App to brief himself on coronavirus news before he goes to work in the morning. 


> After Todd wakes up and has his cup of coffee, he drives to work. Todd feels more comfortable on the desktop version, but the times have forced him to get his news from the app. Once arriving at the hospital, he quickly scrolls through the home page, seeing articles about small business relief funds and the increasing number of Covid-19 cases. Todd wants to see information related to his state, Massacusetts, but has difficulty navigating to information that specific. He wishes there was a centralized tab for all-things coronavirus related.
