## DH 150 Assignment07: High-Fidelity Prototype
##### By Austin Sanchez


### Description of Project
>My project is based on the Wall Street Journal Mobile App. The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as one of the most trustworthy news outlets, so I assumed that its mobile app would be topnotch. Users primarily use the application to quickly and accurately consume news in an organized fashion. After analyzing the current design of the Wall Street Journal mobile app and conducting user research, I found that several key areas can be tweaked to improve the app's organizational structure and ease of use. 

>Through user research, I found that the app's home page design prevents readers from easily navigating through content. There are no markers to identify an article about politics from one about coronavirus besides the headline. Even the headlines are designed in an unorganized style, as certain articles are emphasized with bold font. My interviewee noticed this design flaw when comparing the Wall Street Journal mobile app to that of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that the Wall Street Journal attempted to keep its home page like a traditional newspaper; large headlines for main stories and smaller bullet points for minor articles. However, this design does not give users an optimal experience on a device like an iPhone. 

>The purpose of this prototyping phase is to translate our low-fidelity wireframes into a high-fidelity, functional product. This product can be used easier by potential users, which allows for more feedback and iteration. For my app in particular, this prototyping phase allowed me to get feedback on what a "professional" interface design looks like. Also, it highlighted additional user flows that were overlooked in the low-fidelity phase.

>As a result of the personas I created, I decided to redesign the following three usage scenarios. 

>1. Navigate through topics seamlessly with improved visibility of system status.
>2. Add stocks to a watchlist and view recent news regarding stocks on a user's watchlist.
>3. Customize news feed to give the user control and freedom. 


### Interface Designs
> The Wall Street Journal is recognized for its professional and trustworthy news. The current design of the app uses a white, black, and gray color scheme to emulate the design of a traditional newspaper. I decided to stick to this color scheme to give the app a sense of professionalism and remind the users that they are getting their news from an accredited newspaper.

##### Home Pages with Navigation Bar
>The following image displays how users could use a toggle navigation bar to move to various topics within the app. Through user research, I learned that the WSJ Mobile App was previously difficult to navigate. All the articles appeared on the home page without any way to sort through them by topic. My interviewee suggested a toggle bar like The Washington Post mobile app. When designing this ribbon navigation bar, I needed to give the users a strong visibility of system status. I accomplished this by underlining their current page and bolding the font. Additionally, the "home" tab is highlighted in white on the base navigation bar.

##### Adding Stocks to Watchlist
>The following image displays some interface designs of the "Watchlist" user flow. Like the home page, I used a ribbon navigation bar for the sake of consistency. Once users navigate to the "Market Data" tab, they can toggle from "Market Overview" to "Watchlist." Again, I underlined and bolded the text to allow the user to know his or her location within the app.

##### Customizing Content
>The following image displays some interface designs of how users create a customized news feed. When designing this portion, I wanted to ensure the users had adequate feedback systems. By that, I mean the users needed to be aware when they added a new topic to their customized news feed and when their preferences were saved. After the users tap the "plus" icon, the icon would change into a check. Once the user finished customizing his or her content, they would select "Save Changes" to confirm that their preferences were acknowledged.

### Impression Test and Cognitive Walkthrough
>After conducting my impression test, I had many similar responses to the ones from my peers in class. At first glance, the large headlines make it clear that the app is for news. When asked to give one word that comes to mind after looking at the interfaces, my participant said "professional." This is the exact answer I wanted to hear. The participant believed he could read news articles, access video features, and get information about stocks. Overall, I believe the color scheme, text size, and other design elements make the impression I intended for.

>For the cognitive walkthrough portion, I had my user go through my second usage scenario: adding stocks to a watchlist. Overall, the participant was able to complete the task without any guidance. What I found especially interesting was the path that my user took to get news about the stock he added to his watchlist. Instead of selecting the "news" option in the ribbon bar, my user clicked on the Apple Inc. button. He said it was more intuitive to select Apple, as he expected an individualized news page with more in depth market data and articles. While he still apreciates the "News" tab that has a conglomorate of articles, the individualized page is preferred.

### Accessibility Check
>After downloading the Spark plugin in Figma, I ran color contrast tests for three different texts in my designs. The results are below.

### Interactive Prototype
> [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/v4XBxU0OnMuxDPKhB7irSn/WSJ-Prototype?node-id=50%3A590) is a link to my full interactive prototype in Figma. I've also detailed the user flows for my three usage scenarios.

##### Task #1: Use Home Page Navigation Bar
1. Select or slide to "Politics" tab
2. Select or slide to "Coronavirus" tab
3. Return to "Top Stories"

##### Task #2: Add Stocks to Watchlist
1. Select "Market Data" Tab
2. Navigate to "Watchlist"
3. Click "Add to Watchlist"
4. Search a stock and click "go"
5. Add "Apple"  stock
6. Expand "Apple" for more information
7. Click "Market Data" to return to "Watchlist"
6. Navigate to "News" on watchlist stocks


##### Task #3: Customize News Feed
1. Select MyFeed Tab
2. Click "Add Topics"
3. Select "Asia" and "Europe" to customize interests
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. View "Asia" news feed

### Reflection
>While designing in Figma, it's easy to become inspired with new user flows, buttons, and options. I quickly realized I didn't account for all user options in the "Stock Watchlist" usage scenario. When looking at the wireflow screenshots, the options and potential user flows are overwhelming and the backflows are endless. However, from a designer's point of view, it's important to account for all the possible ways a user could achieve a task. I found that for a news app with a navigation bar, there's more than one way to accomplish the same task. My partcipant in the cognitive walkthrough pointed out the most intuitve path for him along with other feedback.

>Receiving feedback on a high-fidelity prototype allows you to perfect the product. I asked both my roommate and brother for an impression test and cognitive walkthrough, which inspired revisions and iterations in the design process. What I enjoy most about the design process is its iterative nature. Based on the feedback I received, I plan to keep my color scheme, fonts, and material design icons. Both participants acknowledged the professional graphic design of the app. In terms of the user experience, I need to give my users better feedback after they complete tasks. For instance, a pop-up screen to confirm that a stock has been added or preferences have been changed would give the users proper feedback. 

>Overall, the design process went smoothly and the feedback I received inspired new iterations to the user flow. This time, I learned from my past errors and allowed the impression test and cognitive walkthrough to be conversational. I listened to my participant's insights and asked follow-up questions based on their perception of the app. One suggestion that I would consider is creating a "Discover" tab similar to Instagram. Our generation loves pictures that tell stories. The "Discover" tab could have a collage of pictures that, when clicked, direct the users to a related article.
