## DH 150 Assignment07: High-Fidelity Prototype
##### By Austin Sanchez


### Description of Project

### Interface Designs
> The Wall Street Journal is recognized for its professional and trustworthy news. The current design of the app uses a white, black, and gray color scheme to emulate the design of a traditional newspaper. I decided to stick to this color scheme to give the app a sense of professionalism and remind the users that they are getting their news from an accredited newspaper.

##### Home Pages with Navigation Bar
>The following image displays how users could use a toggle navigation bar to move to various topics within the app. Through user research, I learned that the WSJ Mobile App was previously difficult to navigate. All the articles appeared on the home page without any way to sort through them by topic. My interviewee suggested a toggle bar like The Washington Post mobile app. When designing this ribbon navigation bar, I needed to make sure to give the users a strong visibility of system status. I accomplished this by underlining their current page and bolding the font. Additionally, the "home" tab is highlighted in white on the base navigation bar.

##### Adding Stocks to Watchlist
>The following image displays some interface designs of the "Watchlist" user flow. Like the home page, I used a ribbon navigation bar for the sake of consistency. Once users navigate to the "Market Data" tab, they can toggle from "Market Overview" to "Watchlist." Again, I underlined and bolded the text to allow the user to know his or her location within the app.

##### Customizing Content
>The following image displays some interface designs of how users create a customized news feed. When designing this portion, I wanted to ensure the users had adequate feedback systems. By that, I mean the users needed to be aware when they added a new topic to their customized news feed and when their preferences were saved. After the users tap the "plus" icon, the icon would change into a check. Once the user finished customizing his or her content, they would select "Save Changes" to confirm that their preferences were acknowledged.

#### Cognitive Walkthrough


### Reflection
>While designing in Figma, it's easy to become inspired with new user flows, buttons, and options. I quickly realized I didn't account for all user options in the "Stock Watchlist" usage scenario.
