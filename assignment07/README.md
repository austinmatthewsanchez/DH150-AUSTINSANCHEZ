## DH 150 Assignment07: High-Fidelity Prototype
##### By Austin Sanchez


### Description of Project
>My project is based on the Wall Street Journal Mobile App. The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as one of the most trustworthy news outlets, so I assumed that its mobile app would be topnotch. Users primarily use the application to quickly and accurately consume news in an organized fashion. After analyzing the current design of the Wall Street Journal mobile app and conducting user research, I found that several key areas can be tweaked to improve the app's organizational structure and ease of use. 

>Through user research, I found that the app's home page design prevents readers from easily navigating through content. There are no markers to identify an article about politics from one about coronavirus besides the headline. Even the headlines are designed in an unorganized style, as certain articles are emphasized with bold font. My interviewee noticed this design flaw when comparing the Wall Street Journal mobile app to that of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that the Wall Street Journal attempted to keep its home page like a traditional newspaper; large headlines for main stories and smaller bullet points for minor articles. However, this design does not give users an optimal experience on a device like an iPhone. 

>After consolidating my user research, I created three personas to imagine user scenarios. One persona, Josh Ferguson, uses the WSJ for its trustworthy market data. Specifically, he utilizes the app to keep track of his stocks and news regarding emerging companies. My second persona, Alexis Jones, is a college student who wants to stay up-to-date with all things politics from a trustworthy news outlet. She gets frustrated when her news feed becomes cluttered with irrelevant topics. My last persona, Todd Fraser, is a healthcare professional during the coronavirus pandemic. He yearns for a way to easily navigate to the coronavirus coverage he needs within the app. 

>As a result of these personas, I decided to redesign the following three usage scenarios. 

>1. Navigate through topics seamlessly with improved visibility of system status.
>2. Add stocks to a watchlist and view recent news regarding stocks on a user's watchlist.
>3. Customize news feed to give the user control and freedom. 


### Interface Designs
> The Wall Street Journal is recognized for its professional and trustworthy news. The current design of the app uses a white, black, and gray color scheme to emulate the design of a traditional newspaper. I decided to stick to this color scheme to give the app a sense of professionalism and remind the users that they are getting their news from an accredited newspaper.

##### Home Pages with Navigation Bar
>The following image displays how users could use a toggle navigation bar to move to various topics within the app. Through user research, I learned that the WSJ Mobile App was previously difficult to navigate. All the articles appeared on the home page without any way to sort through them by topic. My interviewee suggested a toggle bar like The Washington Post mobile app. When designing this ribbon navigation bar, I needed to give the users a strong visibility of system status. I accomplished this by underlining their current page and bolding the font. Additionally, the "home" tab is highlighted in white on the base navigation bar.

##### Adding Stocks to Watchlist
>The following image displays some interface designs of the "Watchlist" user flow. Like the home page, I used a ribbon navigation bar for the sake of consistency. Once users navigate to the "Market Data" tab, they can toggle from "Market Overview" to "Watchlist." Again, I underlined and bolded the text to allow the user to know his or her location within the app.

##### Customizing Content
>The following image displays some interface designs of how users create a customized news feed. When designing this portion, I wanted to ensure the users had adequate feedback systems. By that, I mean the users needed to be aware when they added a new topic to their customized news feed and when their preferences were saved. After the users tap the "plus" icon, the icon would change into a check. Once the user finished customizing his or her content, they would select "Save Changes" to confirm that their preferences were acknowledged.

### Reflection
>While designing in Figma, it's easy to become inspired with new user flows, buttons, and options. I quickly realized I didn't account for all user options in the "Stock Watchlist" usage scenario.
