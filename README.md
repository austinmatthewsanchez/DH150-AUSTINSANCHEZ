## Heuristic Evaluation - The ESPN App

### OVERVIEW
Growing up, sports played a huge part of my life - reading about them, playing them, watching them. Since I grew up as technology integrated into the everyday lives of Americans, I was able to observe how the methods of covering sports changed. Back in elementary school, I would read the newspaper to keep up with my favorite teams but as time progressed, so did my preferred method of news consumption. Today, I use the ESPN App frequently and decided to formally anaylze its usability.


#### 1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
When opening the ESPN App, the user is directed to the home page. This is made clear not only through thr page's content with top sports headlines, but the "home" button on the navigation bar is bolded. Throughout the app, other methods are used to indicate a user's postion. For instance, when looking at the NFL, a toggle bar notifies users whether they are on the scores, news, standings, or stats page. 

#### 2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
The ESPN App uses appropriate language for the most part to direct the user through the app. However, there are a few pain points that exist, specifically titles for the navigation tabs. It's unclear what content the 'home' and 'more' tabs will give the user. Other than that, the app uses real world symbols (like the play button) to allow users to pull from real-world knowledge to navigate the app. 

#### 3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
The user has options for customization and control in the ESPN app, but it's difficult to find. In order to customize the sports teams, leagues, and players a user would want to follow, the user would have to navigate to the aforementioned "more" tab. Upon arriving, people can add their favorite teams, podcasts and sports, allowing them to filter content that they want. At any time, the user can undo these changes.

#### 4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
The design is consistent throughout all five tabs of the app. For each section, the user has the option to search the app or go directly to settings in the top bar. Additionally, the name of each page is top and centered, allowing users to know their location in the app. As users progress through different articles, scores, etc., back arrows indicate the option to return to a previous screen and sharing icons give users freedom to share content via social media. 

#### 5. ERROR PREVENTION



#### 6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL



#### 7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE



#### 8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
The design attempts to be as simplistic as possible; however, this simplicity could lead to confusion for less tech savvy individuals. For instance, ESPN uses search and settings icons as opposed to spelling out the feature with words. Some individuals would appreciate the simplistic design, while the simplicity would interfere with functionality for others.

### Heuristic Evaluation - The Wall Street Journal App
This quarter, I'm taking a personal finance class that requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis. I downloaded the mobile app and immediately thought it could be designed better for its users. My brother currently writes for The Journal and we discussed his views on the mobile app. He also was shocked that a publication so large could have a digital platform with glaring usability flaws. As a result, I decided to do a heuristic evaluation on The Wall Street Journal App.
