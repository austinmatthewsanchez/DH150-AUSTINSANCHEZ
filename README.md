### Visiting CA State Parks

During this cornonavirus pandemic, I've had the chance to pick up new hobbies, learn new skills, and think of places I want to visit once the quarantine restrictions are lifted. Last week, I visited the CA State Parks website to potentially plan a future trip to one of California's beautful public spaces. The process was confusing and overwhelming. For that reason, I think redesigning the process of learning and planning trips to state parks would be a good project.
