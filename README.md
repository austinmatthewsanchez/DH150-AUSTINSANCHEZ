## My UX Project: Redesigning The Wall Street Journal Mobile App
After analyzing both the ESPN App and The Wall Street Journal mobile app, I've decided to dedicate my project to enhancing the UX design of the WSJ, especially focusing on news coverage during the coronavirus pandemic. I've found that the app can be enhanced in more than 50% of the heuristics. I've detailed my heuristic analysis of both apps below.

## Heuristic Evaluation #1 - The ESPN App

#### OVERVIEW
Growing up, sports played a huge part of my life - reading about them, playing them, watching them. Since I grew up as technology integrated into the everyday lives of Americans, I was able to observe how the methods of covering sports changed. Back in elementary school, I would read the newspaper to keep up with my favorite teams but as time progressed, so did my preferred method of news consumption. Today, I use the ESPN App frequently and decided to formally anaylze its usability.

#### 1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
When opening the ESPN App, the user is directed to the home page. This is made clear not only through the page's content with top sports headlines, but the "home" button on the navigation bar is bolded. Throughout the app, other methods are used to indicate a user's postion. For instance, when looking at the NFL, a toggle bar notifies users whether they are on the scores, news, standings, or stats page. 
##### Severity Rating: 1/3, no usability issues

#### 2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
The ESPN App uses appropriate language for the most part to direct the user through the app. However, there are a few pain points that exist, specifically titles for the navigation tabs. It's unclear what content the 'home' and 'more' tabs will give the user. Other than that, the app uses real world symbols (like the play button) to allow users to pull from real-world knowledge to navigate the app. 
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
The user has options for customization and control in the ESPN app, but it's difficult to find. In order to customize the sports teams, leagues, and players a user would want to follow, the user would have to navigate to the aforementioned "more" tab. Upon arriving, people can add their favorite teams, podcasts and sports, allowing them to filter content that they want. At any time, the user can undo these changes.
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
The design is consistent throughout all five tabs of the app. For each section, the user has the option to search the app or go directly to settings in the top bar. Additionally, the name of each page is top and centered, allowing users to know their location in the app. As users progress through different articles, scores, etc., back arrows indicate the option to return to a previous screen and sharing icons give users freedom to share content via social media. 
##### Severity Rating: 1/3, no usability issues

#### 5. ERROR PREVENTION
On a news app, there are few actions that have extraordinary consequences. If a user finds his or her self on an undesired page, back arrows usually solve the problem.  
##### Severity Rating: 1/3, no usability issues

![NFL Page](/IMG_4520.PNG)

#### 6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
The ESPN home page displays top stories, but does little to allow users to filter stories by leagues, teams, etc. Instead of forcing users to search for content via the search bar, options for specific content (such as NFL free agency, NBA playoffs, and sports betting) should be front and center for users to select. However, when customizing content for the home page, the app does a good job of recalling sports leagues, teams and players instead of forcing the user to recall them.
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE
Some areas of the app treat users as novices and others expect users to have advanced abilities. The horizontal navigation bar is self explanatory and allows most basic users to peruse the app with no issues. However, certain icons like the search feature are placed in obscure postions that make the user question the icon's function. Addtionally, some novice users would prefer text with icons to efficiently navigate the app without clicking wrong buttons. 
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
The design attempts to be as simplistic as possible; however, this simplicity could lead to confusion for less tech savvy individuals. For instance, ESPN uses search and settings icons as opposed to spelling out the feature with words. Some individuals would appreciate the simplistic design, while the simplicity would interfere with functionality for others. 
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues


#### 9. HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
Not many errors occur on a news app, but ESPN accoutns for the ones that can occur. For instance, if your username or password are incorrect, the app uses language to allow users to recognize this error. 
##### Severity Rating: 1/3, no usability issues


#### 10. HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
There are no options for help front and center for users to find. If they need help, they'll have to search through the settings tab. 
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues



## Heuristic Evaluation #2 - The Wall Street Journal App
#### OVERVIEW
This quarter, I'm taking a personal finance class that requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis. I downloaded the mobile app and immediately thought it could be designed better for its users. My brother currently writes for The Journal and we discussed his views on the mobile app. He also was shocked that a publication so large could have a digital platform with glaring usability flaws. As a result, I decided to do a heuristic evaluation on The Wall Street Journal App.

[WSJ App](https://now.wsj.com/mobile/ios/)

#### 1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
The WSJ App currently lets the user know what's going on, but there are several flaws that can be improved. The navigation bar allows users to peruse the app, but it often leaves the user confused which page or section they are on. For instance, the home page doesn't specify the date of the top stories or the section that each story falls under. Additionally, a feature that indicates the length of each article (5 minute read, 10 minute read, etc.) would greatly help busy readers select their articles, allowing them to judge how far they are within a certain piece.
##### Severity Rating: 3/3, usability issues that need to be addressed

![WSJ Page](/IMG_4524.PNG)

#### 2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
The WSJ App uses appropriate language for the most part to direct users through the app. "Sections" is reminiscent of newspaper sections, but the term "topics' might be more applicable since there can be room for more specification within an app. For the market data section, stocks are shown in boxes with their daily increases/decreases. Instead, I would suggest graphs for users to match stock increases with what they are familiar seeing in the real world.
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

![WSJ Page](/IMG_4522.PNG)

#### 3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
The user has limited options for customization and control in The WSJ App. Other news apps allow users to select favorite topics. The WSJ App has a MyWSJ tab, but with limited customization. Users should not only be able to save favorite articles, but also slect content that they would want to appear in a customized feed. The user has the freedom to set specific notifications for breaking news, economy, politics, technology, etc. In the notifications tab. This tab seems out of place and would be more adequately placed under a settings option. 
##### Severity Rating: 3/3, usability issues that need to be addressed

#### 4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
While the app itself is consistent with its visual design, certain features are missing. Users cannot comment on artcles like they can on the web version of The WSJ. Menus and logos sit where they would be expected for the most part. There is a tab for notifications which seems misplaced. Also, a search page would be more beneficial for users to find content they want. Belo
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 5. ERROR PREVENTION
On a news app, there are few actions that have extraordinary consequences. If a user finds his or her self on an undesired page, back arrows usually solve the problem. For the WSJ specifically, users have the option to create a customized watchlist of stocks. I accidentally added a stock that I have no longer want on my watchlist, and it's difficult to remove said company. 
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
The WSJ market data page displays top stocks, but does little to allow users to filter stocks by industries, prices, etc. Instead of forcing users to search for stocks to add to their watchlist, suggested stocks should be front and center for users to select. Also, when customizing content for the home page, the app does a good job of recalling sports leagues, teams and players instead of forcing the user to recall them.
##### Severity Rating: 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE
For the most part, the app does its job. It allows users to access top stories and become informed. Certain buttons and icons cause some confusion though. The search feature is hidden in the corner and the 'notifications' button in the navigation bar is unnecessary. Also, users cannot comment on articles like they can on the webpage. The image below displays the end of an article, where users typically have the option to interact with the author and other users. That feature is absent in the WSJ App.
##### 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
The design attempts to be as simplistic as possible; however, this simplicity could lead to confusion for people trying to customize their content. The home page stacks stories in a news feed style, but only displays titles and subtitles. The articles are not tied to a certain topic nor are they sorted by "top stories" or "must reads." I would suggest maintaining the minimalist design but also providing the user with more relevant information. 
##### 2/3, minor usability issues

#### 9. HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
Not many errors occur on a news app, but the WSJ accounts for the ones that can occur. For instance, if your username or password are incorrect, the app uses language to allow users to recognize this error. 
##### Severity Rating: 1/3, no usability issues

![WSJ Page](/IMG_4525.PNG)

#### 10. HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
The support section only has an option for frequently asked questions. This option redirects the user to a webpage, which is not ideal when using a mobile app. More concrete support topics would help users navigate to their concerns quicker. Having these answers within the app would also make it more user-friendly.
