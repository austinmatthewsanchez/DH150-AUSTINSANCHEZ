## DH150: Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry
###### By Austin Sanchez 

### Specify the Design Challenge
##### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
>My project focuses on the giving users a seamless experience when consuming the daily news. In today's media landscape with coronavirus coverage, citizens need to be informed more than ever. A inconvenient or poorly designed website or mobile app could deter users from staying informed.

##### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
>Specifically for coronavirus coverage, this activity ensures the safety of individuals and their fellow citizens. People are tuning into the news to hear from officials about day-to-day guidelines. All people -- regardless of how they consume news -- need to stay informed for their well-being and the well-being of society.

##### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
>The traditional solution varies with age demographics. Older generations opt for physical newspapers or cable television networks to stay informed, while younger people prefer online websites or mobile apps. My design solution is foucising on mobile apps that currently bombard readers with information without an option to sort through content in a simple manner. Most apps utilize news feeds that post all new articles in one place (whether they have to do with the pandemic or not). At this time, I believe mobile apps should cater to the public's need of knowing about the pandemic and how it will affect their life today.

##### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
> 

### Identify the Target Users
##### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
> Demographic: Young adults, 18-34, who engage with the media and use a mobile phone for a majority of their day-to-day activities. 

> Preferences: Users have the desire to be informed with daily news and choose to be informed through various apps on their phones.

> Expertise: No expertise is needed, just basic knowledge of mobile phone apps/features.

##### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
> Users in this demographic consume news anytime, anywhere because of the convenience factor.

##### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
> Users would open their preferred mobile app of choice, peruse the home page, search for topics their interested in, and read articles that pertain to them. However, the current design of apps doesn't allow users to immediately get coronavirus coverage that affects their day-to-day life. 

### Select Research Methods
>**Interviews:** There's no better way to understand the needs, aspirations, and behaviors of users than talking to them directly. I want to get to know the people I'm designing for and hear about their struggles in their own words. Therefore, I plan to develop a set of questions -- both general and task focused -- that allows me to learn about the users' needs, capabilities, and behaviors. That way, I can highlight pain points and design to solve issues that people face.
