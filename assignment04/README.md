## DH150 Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry
###### By Austin Sanchez 

## Specify the Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
>My project focuses on the giving users a seamless experience when consuming the daily news. In today's media landscape with coronavirus coverage, citizens need to be informed more than ever. A inconvenient or poorly designed website or mobile app could deter users from staying informed.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
>Specifically for coronavirus coverage, this activity ensures the safety of individuals and their fellow citizens. People are tuning into the news to hear from officials about day-to-day guidelines. All people -- regardless of how they consume news -- need to stay informed for their well-being and the well-being of society.

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
>The traditional solution varies with age demographics. Older generations opt for physical newspapers or cable television networks to stay informed, while younger people prefer online websites or mobile apps. My design solution is foucising on mobile apps that currently bombard readers with information without an option to sort through content in a simple manner. Most apps utilize news feeds that post all new articles in one place (whether they have to do with the pandemic or not). At this time, I believe mobile apps should cater to the public's need of knowing about the pandemic and how it will affect their life today.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
> Currently, news apps disperse information in a newspaper-like style. Top stories are able to be viewed by scrolling through the page. This limits the reader to learn about certain topics he or she is interested in. While a search feature allows the user to broadly look for content, a centralized home page with clear topics would allow the reader to customize his or her news search easily. 

## Identify the Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
> Demographic: Young adults, 18-34, who engage with the media and use a mobile phone for a majority of their day-to-day activities. 

> Preferences: Users have the desire to be informed with daily news and choose to be informed through various apps on their phones.

> Expertise: No expertise is needed, just basic knowledge of mobile phone apps/features.

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
> Users in this demographic consume news anytime, anywhere because of the convenience factor. It could be on their way to work or even laying in their bed.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
> Users would open their preferred mobile app of choice, peruse the home page, search for topics they're interested in, and read articles that pertain to them. However, the current design of apps doesn't allow users to immediately get coronavirus coverage that affects their day-to-day life. The goal is to navigate the app in a way that doesn't waste time. I'll ask the users to use various news apps and gather opinions of layouts they prefer. 

## Select Research Methods
>**Interviews:** There's no better way to understand the needs, aspirations, and behaviors of users than talking to them directly. I want to get to know the people I'm designing for and hear about their struggles in their own words. Therefore, I plan to develop a set of questions -- both general and task focused -- that allows me to learn about the users' needs, capabilities, and behaviors. That way, I can highlight pain points and design to solve issues that people face. 

## Research Materials

#### 2. User Data

## Key Insights from the Interview
  **1. How the User Views the WSJ Home Page (11:30)**
>The user acknowledges that newspapers are organized in a way that displays top stories in no particular way. However, he points out that for a mobile app, this should be changed. The WSJ home page is slightly disprganized. 

  **2. Feature in The Washington Post app that the user wants implemented in the WSJ App (19:30)**
>The user prefers The Washington Post design because of its clean and easy to navigate menu bar.


## Reflection
After conducting my interview, I found several responses that validated my concerns with the Wall Street Journal mobile app. Its home page design prevents readers from easily navigating through content in an organized manner. In addition to gathering this information about the mobile app, I also learned a lot about myself and how I could improve with interviews. It's important to ask questions that aren't biased or leading in any way. For instance, it's imperative to include both positive and negative descriptors when asking about someone's overall experience. While gauging the satisfaction of my interviewee's current news consumption process, I asked: "How satisfied or disatisfied are you with your current process?" By not leading the interviewee one way or the other, it's more likely to gather unbiased, wholistic data. I believe I can improve in many ways. This was great practice for my professional career. One thing I noticed was that I tried to stick to the script too much. Even though many of the questions were important, I should have let the conversation flow organically instead of asking questions nonstop. I should have listened to my interviewee's responses better and ask questions based on those responses. Also, I asked a few poorly phrased questions. Instead of trying to rephrase the question to get an answer, I decided to disregard the question entirely. In the future, I would make sure my questions are phrased in a way that won't confuse the interviewee.
