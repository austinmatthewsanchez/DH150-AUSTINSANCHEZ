## DH150: Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry
###### By Austin Sanchez 

### Specify the Design Challenge
##### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
My project focuses on the giving users a seamless experience when consuming the daily news. In today's media landscape with coronavirus coverage, citizens need to be informed more than ever. A inconvenient or poorly designed website or mobile app could deter users from staying informed.

##### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
Specifically for coronavirus coverage, this activity ensures the safety of individuals and their fellow citizens. People are tuning into the news to hear from officials 
##### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution varies with age demographics. Older generations opt for physical newspapers or cable television networks to stay informed, while younger people prefer online websites or mobile apps. My design solution is foucising on mobile apps that currently bombard readers with information without an option to sort through content in a simple manner. Most apps utilize news feeds that post all new articles (whether they have to do with the pandemic or not). At this time, I believe mobile apps should cater to the public's need of having centralized location where they can learn how the pandemic will affect their life today.

##### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
