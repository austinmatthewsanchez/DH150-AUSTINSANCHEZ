## Assignment 02: Usability Testing

### Introduction: Wall Street Journal Mobile App
In our world today, consuming news takes a variety of forms. Old school readers prefer the physical newspaper, Millennials like to peruse the web on their laptop, and the rising Generation Z does everything from their phones. This quarter, one of my courses requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis, so upon subscribing, I immediately analyzed the website and app's usability at a surface level. I found that the website was traditional, yet allowed users to engage in a comprehensive experience. However, the app's usabilty limited users. After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found several issues with the mobile app. 

##### 1. No Visibility of System Status in Major Areas
While the app allowed users to know which page they're on, the pages don't specify the date of the top stories or the section that each story falls under. Additionally, the app lacks a feature that indicates the length of each article (5 minute read, 10 minute read, etc.) which would greatly help busy readers select their articles.
##### 2. Lack of User Control and Freedom
Subscribers use news websites and apps to customize their content. The WSJ App has a MyWSJ tab, but with an automated news feed. Users should not only be able to save favorite articles, but also select specific topics that they would want to appear in a customized feed.
##### 3. Not Consistent with Functions on WSJ.com
While the app itself is consistent with its visual design, certain features are missing. Users cannot comment on artcles like they can on the web version of The WSJ. Also, tracking market data on the app gives users a limited view of stock changes. A discover page would be more beneficial for users to find content they want.

### Purpose of Usability Testing
By conducting this test, I hope to confirm my suspicion of the app's lack of customization and difficulty navigating certain topics. If these usability issues are confirmed, I hope to improve the app by giving users a more centralized and detailed home page and ways to customize their news topics. Addtionally, I hope that participants in the UT will point out small navigational flaws that I've noticed as red flags. In order to test these aspects of the app, I created three tasks for my participant to complete.

      1. Find a centralized location for news coverage on coronavirus and save an article to read later
      
      2. Customize your stock watchlist within the Market Data tab and find news articles relating to your stocks
      
      3. Create a customized news feed that only includes the topics of politics and business

### Usability Testing Data
The following videos capture my participant's facial expressions and user flows while using the WSJ Mobile App. In order to match my participant's actions with his thoughts, please play the screen recording of his phone once he begins his first task in the UT Moderator/Participant video.

### Reflection
After conducting this usability test, I learned many lessons that I will take with me going forward. First and foremost, what I view as a usability issue might be completely invisible for another user. My main concern with the WSJ App was its inability to customize content. While my participant noticed this flaw immediately, he found most trouble with analyzing market data. Also, next time I would not go exclusively by a script and make more of an effort to create a conversational tone during the test. I continually encouraged my participant to speak his mind while completing the tasks, but I should have given him an example of how to articulate his thoughts. More thoughts from my partcipant would have highlighted additional usability issues. For the most part, our test went well. My particpant shed light on flaws that I didn't realize prior to the interview. For example, there's no way within the app to look at all past articles relating to a particular topic. Also, he pointed out the lack of clarity in terms of article topics on the home page. Overall, I learned an immense amount from my first official usability test and I hope to refine these skills as these tests grow in volume.
