## Assignment 02: Usability Testing

### Introduction: Wall Street Journal Mobile App
In our world today, consuming news takes a variety of forms. Old school readers prefer the newspaper, Millennials like to peruse the web on their laptop, and the rising Generation Z does everything from their phones. This quarter, one of my courses requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis, so upon subscribing, I immediately analyzed the website and app's usability at a surface level. I found that the website was traditional, yet allowed users to engage in a comprehensive experience. However, the app's usabilty limited users. After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found several issues with the mobile app. 

##### 1. No Visibility of System Status in Major Areas
While the app allowed users to know which page they're on, the pages don't specify the date of the top stories or the section that each story falls under. Additionally, a the app lacks a feature that indicates the length of each article (5 minute read, 10 minute read, etc.) which would greatly help busy readers select their articles.
##### 2. Lack of User Control and Freedom
Subscribers use news websites and apps to customize their content. The WSJ App has a MyWSJ tab, but with automated customization. Users should not only be able to save favorite articles, but also select specific topics that they would want to appear in a customized feed.
##### 3. Not Consistent with Functions on WSJ.com
While the app itself is consistent with its visual design, certain features are missing. Users cannot comment on artcles like they can on the web version of The WSJ. Menus and logos sit where they would be expected for the most part. There is a tab for notifications which seems misplaced. Also, a search page would be more beneficial for users to find content they want.

### Purpose of Usability Testing
By conducting this test, I hope to confirm my suspicion of the app's lack of customization and difficulty navigating certain topics. If these usability issues are confirmed, I hope to improve the app by giving users a more centralized and detailed home page and ways to customize their news topics. Addtionally, I hope that participants in the UT will point out small navigational flaws that have also been red flags.
