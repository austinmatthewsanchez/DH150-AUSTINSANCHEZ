### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
>What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.


### Clear design statement: 
>What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 


### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
>In our world today, consuming news takes a variety of forms. Old school readers prefer the physical newspaper, Millennials like to peruse the web on their laptop, and the rising Generation Z does everything from their phones. This quarter, one of my courses requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis, so upon subscribing, I immediately analyzed the website and app's usability at a surface level. I found that the website was traditional, yet allowed users to engage in a comprehensive experience. However, the app's usabilty limited users. After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found several issues with the mobile app.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
>The purpose of this prototyping phase is to translate our low-fidelity wireframes into a high-fidelity, functional product. This product can be used easier by potential users, which allows for more feedback and iteration. For my app in particular, this prototyping phase allowed me to get feedback on what a "professional" interface design looks like. Also, it highlighted additional user flows that were overlooked in the low-fidelity phase. By using Figma, I translated the wireframes into an interactive prototype with the following three usage scenarios.

1. Navigate through topics seamlessly with improved visibility of system status (a navigation bar).
2. Add stocks to a watchlist and view recent news regarding stocks on a user's watchlist.
3. Customize news feed to give the user control and freedom.
