# Redesigning the Wall Street Journal Mobile App
#### Austin Sanchez


### Introduction 
This quarter, I'm taking a personal finance class that requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis. The first week of the course, I downloaded the mobile app and immediately thought it could be designed better for its users. My brother currently writes for The Journal and we discussed his views on the mobile app. He also was shocked that a publication so large could have a digital platform with glaring usability flaws. The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as one of the most trustworthy news outlets, so I assumed that its mobile app would be topnotch. Users primarily use the application to quickly and accurately consume news in an organized fashion. After analyzing the current design of the Wall Street Journal mobile app and conducting user research, I found that several areas can be tweaked to improve the app's organizational structure and ease of use.


### Design Statement 
My project focuses on the giving users a seamless experience when consuming the daily news. In today's media landscape with coronavirus coverage, citizens need to be informed more than ever. An inconvenient or poorly designed website or mobile app could deter users from staying informed. Users visit news platform for different purposes. Some want to peruse top stories, while others are looking for specific information about a certain topic. Therefore, I decided to redesign key features to enhance user control and freedom when consuming content. Specifically, the Wall Street Journal's organizational structure and navigation can be improved.


### Competitor Analysis
In our world today, consuming news takes a variety of forms. Old school readers prefer the physical newspaper, Millennials like to peruse the web on their laptop, and the rising Generation Z does everything from their phones. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter one of my courses requires students to read the Wall Street Journal on a weekly basis, so upon subscribing, I immediately analyzed the website and app's usability at a surface level. I found that the website was traditional, yet allowed users to engage in a comprehensive experience. However, the app's usabilty limited users. For instance, the navigation from topic to topic was confusing. Also, there was no rhyme or rhythm to the way articles were organized on the home page. After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I found several issues with the mobile app.

### User Research
Through user research, I found that the app's home page design prevents readers from easily navigating through content. There are no markers to identify an article about politics from one about coronavirus besides the headline. Even the headlines are designed in an unorganized style, as certain articles are emphasized with bold font. My interviewee noticed this design flaw when comparing the Wall Street Journal mobile app to that of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that the Wall Street Journal attempted to keep its home page like a traditional newspaper; large headlines for main stories and smaller bullet points for minor articles. However, this design does not give users an optimal experience on a device like an iPhone.

### UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows designers to put themselves in the shoes of their users. By understanding their needs, capabilities, and behaviors, designers can create products that improve lives. The process of UX storytelling--from persona creation to journey mapping--allows designers to shift their persepctive. This perspective switch is essential to getting to the core of users' pain points and issues. The development of a persona allows a team to be on the same page when making design decisions.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
After consolidating my user research, I created three personas to imagine user scenarios. One persona, Josh Ferguson, uses the WSJ for its trustworthy market data. Specifically, he utilizes the app to keep track of his stocks and news regarding emerging companies. My second persona, Alexis Jones, is a college student who wants to stay up-to-date with all things politics from a trustworthy news outlet. She gets frustrated when her news feed becomes cluttered with irrelevant topics. My last persona, Todd Fraser, is a healthcare professional during the coronavirus pandemic. He yearns for a way to easily navigate to the coronavirus coverage he needs within the app.

### High-Fidelity Prototype 
The purpose of this prototyping phase is to translate our low-fidelity wireframes into a high-fidelity, functional product. This product can be used easier by potential users, which allows for more feedback and iteration. For my app in particular, this prototyping phase allowed me to get feedback on what a "professional" interface design looks like. Also, it highlighted additional user flows that were overlooked in the low-fidelity phase. By using Figma, I translated the wireframes into an interactive prototype with the following three usage scenarios.

1. Navigate through topics seamlessly with improved visibility of system status (a navigation bar).
2. Add stocks to a watchlist and view recent news regarding stocks on a user's watchlist.
3. Customize news feed to give the user control and freedom.
