## DH 150 Assignment06: Low-Fidelity Prototype
##### By Austin Sanchez


### Description and Tasks
>My project is based on the Wall Street Journal Mobile App. The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as one of the most trustworthy news outlets, so I assumed that its mobile app would be topnotch. Users primarily use the application to quickly and accurately consume news in an organized fashion. After analyzing the current design of the Wall Street Journal mobile app and conducting user research, I found that several key areas can be tweaked to improve the app's organizational structure and ease of use. 

>Through user research, I found that the app's home page design prevents readers from easily navigating through content. There are no markers to identify an article about politics to one about coronavirus besides the headline. Even the headlines are designed in an unorganized style, as certain articles are emphasized with bold font. My interviewee noticed this design flaw when comparing the Wall Street Journal mobile app to that of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that the Wall street Journal attempted to keep its home page like a traditional newspaper; large headlines for main stories and smaller bullet points for minor articles. However, this design does not give users an optimal experience on a device like an iPhone. 

>After consolidating my user research, I created three personas to imagine user scenarios. One persona, Josh Ferguson, uses the WSJ for its trustworthy market data. Specifically, he utilizes the app to keep track of his stocks and news regarding emerging companies. My second persona, Alexis Jones, is an aspiring public official who wants to stay up-to-date with all things politics from a trustworthy news outlet. She gets frustrated when her news feed becomes cluttered with irrelevant topics. My last persona, Todd Fraser, is a healthcare professional during the coronavirus pandemic. He yearns for a way to easily navigate to the coronavirus coverage he needs within the app. 

>As a result of these personas, I decided to redesign the following three usage scenarios. 

>1. Add stocks to a watchlist and view recent news regarding stocks on a user's watchlist.
>3. Customize news feed to give the user control and freedom. 
>3. Navigate through topics seamlessly with improved visibility of system status.
