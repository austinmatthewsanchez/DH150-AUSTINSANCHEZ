## DH 150 Assignment06: Low-Fidelity Prototype
##### By Austin Sanchez


### Description
>My project is based on the Wall Street Journal Mobile App. The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as one of the most trustworthy news outlets, so I assumed that its mobile app would be topnotch. Users primarily use the application to quickly and accurately consume news in an organized fashion. After analyzing the current design of the Wall Street Journal mobile app and conducting user research, I found that several key areas can be tweaked to improve the app's organizational structure and ease of use. 

>Through user research, I found that the app's home page design prevents readers from easily navigating through content. There are no markers to identify an article about politics to one about coronavirus besides the headline. Even the headlines are designed in an unorganized style, as certain articles are emphasized with bold font. My interviewee noticed this design flaw when comparing the Wall Street Journal mobile app to that of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that the Wall street Journal attempted to keep its home page like a traditional newspaper; large headlines for main stories and smaller bullet points for minor articles. However, this design does not give users an optimal experience on a device like an iPhone. 

### Tasks
>1. Navigate through topics seamlessly with improved visibility of system status.
>2. View recent news regarding stocks on a user's watchlist.
>3. Customize news feed to give the user control and freedom.
